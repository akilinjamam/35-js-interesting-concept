// when undefined is shown?

// if you dont decleare the variable
// if you decleare the variable but dont assign the value of  the variable
// if you dont give the parameter-value in the function
// if you dont return variable explicitly
// if you search element which you want to get from array and if that element doesnt exist in the array.
// if the property from object which is not exist and you are searching that property from that object.

// what is null?
// null means nothing exists. it is closest to undefined. but there is small difference between them.
// null means any value that you are knowingly kept empty for any other purpose or you will update the value of variables , thats why you kept it as empty. undefined means any mistake that is done . but you dont know. null is shown when the data can not be load from API any logical reason.
